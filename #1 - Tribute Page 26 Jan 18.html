    There are many text editors out there however not all are created equal. There are text editors and then there are developer text editors, the developer versions have more options avalible and come with a steep learning curve. Ideally we want a Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) this allows us to work all aspects of our code under one roof.

    There are many options but some of the best are as follows:

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> is one of the more powerful editors avalible. This editor is throught to be best for people that program hard all day. It is effectively its own operating system and supports multiple IDEs.</li>

          <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> is one of the most powerful editors avalible. This editor is thought to be for people that do lots of code reading with some programing but need powerful functionality. This program supports multiple IDEs.</li>

        </ul>
       Do you have another developer text editor that you love?
        <form action="#">
          <input type="text" placeholder="Your submision here!" required>
